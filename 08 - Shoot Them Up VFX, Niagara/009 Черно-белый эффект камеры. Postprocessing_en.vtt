00:00:05.211 --> 00:00:10.676
In this tutorial, we'll add another mini effect. In spectator mode, let's make the final image black and white.

00:00:11.016 --> 00:00:13.980
This is done using posprocessing - visual effects that are

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.677
applied to the final rendered frame. We launch our game.

00:00:20.904 --> 00:00:29.762
Select the character in the object tree. In the component tree, select the camera component.

00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:37.280
Find the posprocessing category in the details panel. In this category, there are a bunch of properties that affect

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.686
the final frame, for example, in the image effects category, you can change the vignette, that is, shading around the edges.

00:00:44.686 --> 00:00:52.000
You can also adjust the gain, that is, the noise. A little noise appears on the image,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.260
like from an old TV, and so on. Pocessing can be used for both visual effects and to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.560
create the atmosphere of the frame through color correction. Find the property saturation, which is responsible for the

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.170
saturation of the frame, and set the last value to zero. This value is responsible for the brightness,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.600
that is, in fact, we got a black and white picture. We were editing the real-time

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.090
camera settings , nothing was saved and we only need this effect when we are

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.355
in spectator mode. We are using the default observer class. Let's expand it.

00:01:27.123 --> 00:01:36.794
Create a new blueprint. We inherit from SpectatorPawn. We call the blueprint BP_STUSpectatorPawn.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.643
Let's install it right away in world settings.

00:01:43.713 --> 00:01:44.635
Open asset.

00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:51.370
And the first thing we need to do is add our own camera component. To do this, click

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.739
Add Component, enter - camera and we have created a camera component.

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:01.030
The only setting that needs to be set for this component is to set the checkbox

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.243
use pawn control rotation to true - so that the camera rotates depending on the movement of our mouse.

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:12.000
And we repeat the setting we just made. In posprocessing, set the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.309
last component to zero in saturation . We launch. We run into the sphere.

00:02:20.154 --> 00:02:25.600
We die and in spectator mode we have a black and white effect on the camera.

00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:33.260
We will not rewrite this in C ++. This is a fairly cosmetic change that a blueprint is entitled to exist.
