00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.846
In this lesson, we will work on the sounds of the character: the sounds of walking, running and jumping.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:18.950
Let's figure out how to play sounds linked to animation. Create an additional folder in the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.870
sound directory , call it character. We'll need some SoundQues, let's get them ready.

00:00:28.463 --> 00:00:30.663
The first asset is called SQ_FootstepsWalk.

00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:42.389
This SoundQue will sound the sounds of the character's footsteps. Duplicate. We call the next SoundQue SQ_Run.

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:49.440
This asset will be played when the character runs. The next SoundQue is jump start. It will play

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.920
when the character jump animation starts and the last SoundQue - jump end. This asset will be played

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.080
when the character lands. Let's open all the assets right away to make it easier to drag and drop sounds.

00:01:07.223 --> 00:01:14.442
Go to ExternalContent, to the sounds directory, open the footsteps folder.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:21.447
This folder contains the voice acting of the character's steps. There are different sounds for different surfaces that the

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:26.598
character walks on. We will not define the surface for the steps.

00:01:26.598 --> 00:01:32.693
In general, this is not difficult to implement. This is done in the same way as we did the impact effects. Let's play the sound of grass,

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:36.734
metal.

00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:42.408
We will be using tile sounds.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.940
As we can see, there are several different sounds for steps. We can add all

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:00.000
SoundWave data to our SoundQue and play it randomly. This will ensure that the sound of footsteps is not monotonous.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.315
Add the random node. Add pins and connect all sounds to the random node.

00:02:10.502 --> 00:02:16.446
You can also delete an unnecessary pin by right-clicking on it. Let's test it.

00:02:22.043 --> 00:02:25.460
At each step of the character, a random sound will be selected.

00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:31.968
This is how I added these sounds to the wrong SoundQue. Let's move them to Walk.

00:02:34.658 --> 00:02:42.070
Moving on, open the animation editor. Select the run forward animation.

00:02:42.677 --> 00:02:48.065
Sounds for animation are very easy to add. This is done in the same way as anim notify.

00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:53.403
On any of the tracks, we can right-click,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:03.103
select add notify from the menu and find play sound in the submenu. A special anim notify has been added to the track,

00:03:03.103 --> 00:03:08.544
which has a property sound in the details panel. We choose our sound of footsteps.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.430
If we move the slider in the timeline, we can immediately hear this sound. On the timeline, we

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.570
need to position the given anim notify at the moment the foot touches the ground. We do this

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.993
approximately by dragging anim notify to the position we need and press the spacebar to play it.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.480
This sound needs to be added for the other leg as well. The foot lands on the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.110
ground at the very end of the animation. Let's add an extra anim notify.

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:49.871
Selecting the sound asset for the steps.

00:03:51.517 --> 00:03:53.083
Let's check how it sounds.

00:03:55.273 --> 00:03:57.319
You can move it a little to the right.

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:11.172
So, you can add sounds on the timeline. This functionality is logical to use in blueprint. This is quite convenient,

00:04:11.172 --> 00:04:16.450
plus a sound designer can easily do this and customize this anim notify with an accuracy of

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:23.654
hundredths of a second. I will now fast forward to add these sounds for other animations.

00:04:23.654 --> 00:04:30.582
We have animations for running to the right, left and back. The logic for adding sounds will be exactly the same here.

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:39.126
The second animation is ready.

00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:47.274
The third animation is ready.

00:04:59.004 --> 00:05:04.246
And the last animation is also ready. Let's test how it works right away. The only thing is,

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:11.347
let's turn off our NPCs, otherwise there will be a cacophony now. Remove all the behavior tree logic.

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:16.609
And we start the game.

00:05:24.687 --> 00:05:32.949
The first part is ready. Move on. It is necessary to add sounds for the running animation. They are located in the foley folder.

00:05:35.338 --> 00:05:39.718
There are also several sounds. They have the text "run" in their names.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.440
Add all sounds to SQ_FootstepsRun.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.626
We also add a random node.

00:06:02.457 --> 00:06:06.309
We will play these sounds when our character starts to run.

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:13.556
Let's set up the SoundQue for jumping right away. Sound files are also located in this foley directory.

00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:22.912
We select three sounds, they will be played randomly when the character starts jumping.

00:06:23.647 --> 00:06:29.233
Add jump start to SoundQue. Add the random node.

00:06:34.517 --> 00:06:35.288
Checking.

00:06:41.765 --> 00:06:46.621
For the character to land, there are different sounds for different surfaces.

00:06:46.621 --> 00:06:51.846
By analogy with running, we will only use sounds for tile.

00:06:59.081 --> 00:07:04.311
We select these assets, transfer them to the jump end.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.898
All the necessary SoundQues are ready. Let's add them to our animations.

00:07:12.688 --> 00:07:18.118
We start with a running animation. The asset is called RoadieRun_Fwd.

00:07:27.118 --> 00:07:31.257
Added for running animation. Next, open the jump start asset.

00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:40.131
Add a sound somewhere at the beginning when the feet start to lift off the ground.

00:07:42.288 --> 00:07:46.508
Set SoundQue jump start and check.

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:59.478
And the last animation is the jump end. Let's add a sound at the very beginning of the timeline.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.106
We select the appropriate SoundQue and check.

00:08:11.701 --> 00:08:13.981
Everything is ready, let's test it in the game.

00:08:21.072 --> 00:08:22.922
Let's go over, hold down shift.

00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:30.617
Checking the jump.

00:08:37.458 --> 00:08:39.433
This concludes the current lesson.
