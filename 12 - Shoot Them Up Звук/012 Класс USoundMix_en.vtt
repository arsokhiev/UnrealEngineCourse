00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:11.155
In this lesson, we will consider a new asset that allows you to control the settings of sound classes.

00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:18.384
It is called sound mix. There may be situations in the game in which some sounds should be louder and others quieter.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:23.220
We can already control the volume using sound classes. Sound mix allows you to do

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.890
this more efficiently. You can create multiple sound mixes. In fact, it is a preset

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.454
for the current game situation: what settings (in particular the volume) should be in the sound classes,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.618
and if the game situation has changed, we simply turn on another sound mix.

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:47.816
Let's look at an example. Create a new sound mix and name it sound mix default.

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:57.905
We open this asset. It has several categories of settings: an equalizer, we will not be interested in it.

00:00:58.677 --> 00:01:05.080
The sound mix category contains parameters for the time the current settings are applied, and the main category that

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.040
interests us is called sound classes. This is an array. We will add those sound classes whose parameter

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:21.167
we want to change, for example, add the ambient sound class and change the volume adjuster parameter to it, set, for example, 0.2,

00:01:21.553 --> 00:01:28.000
that is, we will make all sounds of this sound class a little quieter. This volume adjuster

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.683
is not a specific volume value, but a value by which we multiply the current volume value.

00:01:34.683 --> 00:01:43.207
We will also make the sounds of charter quieter and, for example, add the sounds of weapons.

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:54.519
set volume adjuster to 0.7, save, go to the project settings, enter sound in the search box.

00:01:54.905 --> 00:02:00.346
We can set the sound mix by default. Property is called default base sound mix.

00:02:00.346 --> 00:02:07.817
We specify our sound mix default, that is, by default, our sound mix will affect the volume of all sound classes

00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:14.170
that we added to the array. In our current project, this is already enough. For a test, let's see

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:22.000
how we can switch between different sound mixes. Create a new sound mix and name it fade out.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.534
This sound mix will smoothly lead the sound of the master class to 0. Add the master class to the sound array.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.411
Set the volume multiplier to 0, set property apply to children to true.

00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:45.697
This means that this multiplier will also be applied to the child sound classes. Let's change the

00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:51.529
fade in time parameter - the parameter is responsible for the time for which this sound mix will be applied.

00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:57.280
and additionally set fade out time also to 5 - this parameter is inverse, it is responsible

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.194
for the time during which the mix will be canceled. In the playercontroller, add the event of pressing

00:03:03.194 --> 00:03:08.844
the 1 key. When this key is pressed, we will apply sound mix fade out.

00:03:09.253 --> 00:03:16.337
This is done using a function called push sound mix modifier. Give it sound mix fade out.

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:23.407
This function is located in the gameplay statics library, so it will not be difficult to call it from the code,

00:03:24.541 --> 00:03:32.080
and when you press the 2 key, we will remove this sound mix. The function is called pop sound mix modifier.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.831
For the rifle, we will add more cartridges so that our shooting is not interrupted for reloading.

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:47.785
We start the game.

00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:04.292
I pressed 1 on the keyboard and the sound faded away. Let's hit the deuce.

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:20.570
Thus, using the sound mix, we can control the settings of the sound classes.

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:28.488
I remove the logic from the blueprint, we did it exclusively for the test. In our project, one sound mix will be enough,

00:04:28.488 --> 00:04:33.360
in which we can configure, if necessary, various parameters of the sound classes.
