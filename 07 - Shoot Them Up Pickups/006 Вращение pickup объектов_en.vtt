00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.910
In this tutorial, we will add a cosmetic thing: we will make our pickup rotate around the z-axis.

00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:18.680
The rotation angle will be calculated randomly, this will happen at the start of the game and also every time

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.290
we pick up the pickup. Let's create an additional variable in the private section and call it RotationYaw.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.937
It will store the angle by which we want to rotate our pickup

00:00:28.937 --> 00:00:33.860
and will also create an additional function, which we will call GenerateRotationYaw. The name speaks

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.406
for itself - this function will calculate the angle we need.

00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:41.107
Go to the .cpp file.

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:45.572
We define the function.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.920
The rotation angle will be added every frame, so go to the Tick function. The actor function that

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.423
can change the rotation is called AddActorLocalRotation, or AddActorWorldRotation.

00:01:00.423 --> 00:01:04.266
In our situation, it makes absolutely no difference which function we will use.

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:09.008
Both of these functions in the case of our simplest object will solve the same problem.

00:01:09.582 --> 00:01:15.170
Pass the FRotator function as a parameter. All angles, except for yaw, are zero, and directly

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.554
to yaw we pass the RotationYaw variable, which we now have to calculate.

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.360
Each Tick will call this function and the object will

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.921
rotate uniformly by the RotationYaw. We call the GenerateRotationYaw function on BeginPlay

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.900
and also add a call to this function at the moment when we respawn.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.942
Thus, there will be a little variation. Each time we pick up the pickup, the rotation angle will change.

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:50.678
And we just need to implement the GenerateRotationYaw function. Let's go into it.

00:01:50.678 --> 00:01:55.622
In this function, we need to calculate the value of the RotationYaw variable.

00:01:55.622 --> 00:02:02.869
The random number generation function is in the FMath class. We'll use a function called RandRange.

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:10.072
This function returns a random number from a segment, the extreme points of which we pass as parameters.

00:02:10.543 --> 00:02:15.500
We will not create additional variables for these numbers, add them to the blueprint, because

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.160
this is a rather minor thing. And let's create an additional variable called Direction.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.422
She will be responsible for the direction of rotation. The variable must be 1 or -1.

00:02:28.853 --> 00:02:35.649
To do this, we just need to generate a random boolean value. The corresponding function to generate is called RandBool.

00:02:36.648 --> 00:02:47.945
If this function returned true, then we assign the variable the value 1, and if false, then -1

00:02:48.332 --> 00:02:53.716
We could generate RotationYaw from the segment, for example, from -1 to 1,

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:59.293
but then our variable can be assigned 0 and our pickup will not move.

00:03:00.394 --> 00:03:01.485
We start the game.

00:03:02.925 --> 00:03:08.975
Pickups started spinning: one clockwise, the other counterclockwise. We were so lucky.

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:15.460
Direction was generated differently for the given two pickups. If we press shift + f1 and after

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.955
that the eject button in the interface, then the controller no longer controls the character, we can safely

00:03:20.955 --> 00:03:25.750
move around the scene. If you select pickup, you can observe how the local rotation changes.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.296
Also in the interface there is a cube that can show the axes in world coordinates.

00:03:30.296 --> 00:03:35.738
We see that they are not moving. And you can also press it again and the axes will start to rotate.
