00:00:05.884 --> 00:00:10.770
We have a new section. It will be dedicated to pickups, that is, items that our character can

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.400
pick up. We'll do two pickups with you: one of them will be an ammo pickup. It will have several

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.230
parameters: the number of magazines our player can get if he picks up this pickup, the

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:30.000
type of weapon this magazine belongs to, and also respawn time - the time after which

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.300
this pickup will appear on the scene again. The second pickup is a health pickup. Its main parameter is the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.310
number of health units our player will receive. Our lives are resumed on a timer,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.110
so overall this pickup is a bit useless. An educational moment is important for us here

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.850
- to see how to handle pickups of various types. Pickup will add

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.802
ammo to the launcher. Let's switch weapons and shoot some bullets.

00:00:58.048 --> 00:01:04.220
And when we run into the pickup, our arsenal is full. If we run into the damage sphere, we will waste

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.592
some life. We select health and the health bar fills up instantly.

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:13.638
If the arsenal and health are completely full, then we will not be able to take pickups.
