00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:09.780
Hello everyone! We are starting a new section in which we will look at artificial intelligence.

00:00:10.147 --> 00:00:16.039
Let's program the brains of our character. Let's explore the various unreal subsystems that allow you to do this.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.653
Let's pay the most attention to the behavior tree - the tree of behavior. We will teach our NPC

00:00:21.653 --> 00:00:26.905
to move around the scene, pick up health pickups, ammunition.

00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:36.812
Let's create services that will find the enemy, automatically shoot, and change weapons. Let's consider what decorator, task is.

00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:42.380
We will also consider a special subsystem EQS, which allows you to

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:48.663
analyze the space around the character. At the end of the section, we will get a completely playable version.

00:00:49.147 --> 00:00:54.420
Plus, let's look at how to output specific debug information related to artificial intelligence.
