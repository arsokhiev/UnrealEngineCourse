00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:09.152
Before packing the project, let's set up the scene a bit.

00:00:09.152 --> 00:00:14.246
Let's remove such an EQS TestPawn. Place the pickups more evenly across the stage.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:20.034
Let's also add some additional AI Characters to the scene.

00:00:26.418 --> 00:00:31.008
And make sure that AI Character has a rifle weapon by default.

00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:35.867
Optionally, you can add randomization of the weapon array to the BeginPlay.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.851
Let's test a simulation with several NPCs. Click Play.

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:47.403
Our map is not final, but in general it is already possible to play.

00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:53.395
Let's consider another such moment. If we have an open asset behavior tree.

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:59.521
When there are several NPCs on the scene, the behavior tree has a special combobox,

00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:04.161
in which you can select the controller whose tree we want to observe.

00:01:05.972 --> 00:01:12.625
Everything is ready for packing, let's check that packaga is being created. Don't forget to save the map.

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:20.139
Click on save current, open the file, package project, windows 64-bit and wait for the build of the game.

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:27.076
The game packaged without errors. This concludes the current section.
