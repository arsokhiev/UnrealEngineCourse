00:00:06.098 --> 00:00:15.797
Let's complete the logic for changing weapons. Let's create an additional boolean variable called EquipAnimInProgress.

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:20.573
When the weapon change animation occurs, this variable will be set to true.

00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:28.000
For convenience, we will create two additional functions: the first will be called CanFire

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.867
It returns true when we can shoot and the second function CanEquip - it will return true

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:40.569
when we can change weapons. Let's create a body for each function in a .cpp file

00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:44.708
and first, let's deal with our new flag.

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:54.990
Let's go to the EquipWeapon function. When we start changing weapons, we must change the value of this variable to true.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.186
And when the animation ends, this variable is false in the OnEquipFinished function.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.657
The CanEquip function will return the negation of the given variable, that is, we can equip

00:01:09.657 --> 00:01:14.112
when the value of the variable EquipAnimInProgress = false.

00:01:14.898 --> 00:01:20.790
Let's simplify our OnEquipFinished function a bit. We can remove the comparison condition for mesh

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.661
under the first if, that is, if the meshes are not equal, then we exit the function and we can also remove the log -

00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:36.271
we no longer need it. Let's copy the CanEquip function. We will call it in the NextWeapon function,

00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:40.800
that is, when we want to change weapons, we check whether we can do this and if

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:49.294
we cannot, then we simply exit the function. Let's remove the CurrentWeapon check for nullptr in the CanFire function.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.377
That is, this is one of the conditions for firing: the CurrentWeapon pointer should not be nullptr

00:01:58.377 --> 00:02:04.720
and the second condition is checking our new flag EquipAnimInProgress

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:08.486
That is, when changing weapons, we cannot shoot either.

00:02:09.414 --> 00:02:10.657
Copy CanFire

00:02:12.812 --> 00:02:17.447
Paste into StartFire. Let's check what we got.

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:27.343
We start the game. And now we can start the change of weapons only when the previous change is over.

00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:31.242
And also, if we try to shoot,

00:02:33.272 --> 00:02:37.043
then we cannot do this while changing weapons.
