Hello everyone! In this section, we will develop a weapon component, set up aiming animations,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:20.168
change weapons, and reload. Let's consider how collisions work, line trace and create 2 classes of weapons: a

00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:26.770
grenade launcher and a rifle. Let's set up the damage to the character and also deal with the data structure

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.686
for storing cartridges and magazines. Let's get down to development. The section will be large enough.
