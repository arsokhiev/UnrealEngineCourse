In this lesson, we have our own work. It is necessary to create the main menu button,

1
00:10.650 --> 00:16.050
by clicking on which we will return to the main menu. The button needs to be added to both the pause widget

2
00:16.050 --> 00:22.359
and the game over widget. That is, you can create one widget in which the button will be located:

3
00:22.359 --> 00:28.800
click on it and get to the main menu. The name of the menu level will be stored in the GameInstance class.

4
00:30.446 --> 00:35.906
Let's start solving the task. Let's start by adding a c ++ class for a new widget.

5
00:39.907 --> 00:43.688
Let's call the class STUGoToMenuWidget.

6
00:45.452 --> 00:47.191
Click on the create class button.

7
00:48.630 --> 00:55.268
In the GameInstance class, create a new property that will hold the name of the menu level.

8
00:57.526 --> 01:02.574
We name it MenuLevelName. The default will also be None.

9
01:03.225 --> 01:08.330
And create a getter for this property.

10
01:10.380 --> 01:18.970
Go to the GoToMenu header file for the widget. We need a property for the button.

11
01:21.480 --> 01:27.533
We name the button GoToMenuButton. Add a forward declaration for the UButton class.

12
01:29.960 --> 01:33.920
We override the NativeOnInitialized function.

13
01:35.240 --> 01:40.923
And in the private section, add a function that will be called when this button is pressed.

14
01:42.709 --> 01:45.246
We call the function OnGoToMenu.

15
01:47.412 --> 01:54.526
Go to the .cpp file and create a body for each of the functions.

16
02:03.894 --> 02:10.770
We include all the necessary header files.

17
02:12.248 --> 02:17.743
In the NativeOnInitialized function, add a callback function to the OnClicked delegate.

18
02:24.253 --> 02:28.054
In the OnGoToMenu function, a menu level must be opened.

19
02:31.527 --> 02:36.104
In fact, you and I can copy all the code that is in the menu widget.

20
02:40.715 --> 02:44.277
Copy the code and paste it into the OnGoToMenu function.

21
02:46.718 --> 02:51.588
We need to open the menu level, for this we call the GetMenuLevelName function.

22
02:55.371 --> 02:59.464
Replace the message if you forgot to specify the name of the level menu.

23
03:00.674 --> 03:05.572
And we will also create our own logging category for this widget.

24
03:09.148 --> 03:11.968
Let's change the logging category in UE_LOG.

25
03:13.550 --> 03:15.260
And we have everything ready. We start.

26
03:17.896 --> 03:23.066
Create a blueprint widget, call it WBP_GoToMenu.

27
03:25.584 --> 03:31.267
Open asset. We can copy the entire button from any widget.

28
03:33.658 --> 03:39.775
In the SizeBox, set the size to content to true and change the text to the main menu.

29
03:41.860 --> 03:50.570
Reparent the blueprint. We specify STUGoToMenuWidget as the parent class

30
03:51.204 --> 03:54.690
and name the Go To Menu Button.

31
03:57.609 --> 04:04.423
Add a button to game pause. First, we can wrap the size box in a horizontal box.

32
04:09.250 --> 04:18.500
Add our widget to a new horizontal box and also add a spacer between these buttons.

33
04:22.086 --> 04:24.730
For x we ​​indicate the value 50. We

34
04:28.283 --> 04:30.894
do the same in the game over widget.

35
04:34.667 --> 04:37.300
Let's check. We start the game.

36
04:38.816 --> 04:49.188
We press pause. Click main menu. We have an error in editor. We have not specified the name of the menu level in GameInstance.

37
04:49.608 --> 04:52.486
Actually, an error message should have printed.

38
04:52.923 --> 05:00.530
We have a copy-paste error. Checking for None requires the name of the menu level. Correcting the moment.

39
05:02.450 --> 05:09.845
Compile in the editor. We open the log. We start the game. We pause.

40
05:09.845 --> 05:17.784
Click on the main menu button. The message is now printed. Let's set the name of the level to GameInstance.

41
05:19.779 --> 05:20.690
MenuLevel

42
05:24.000 --> 05:30.183
Compile. We check again. We pause and return to the main menu.

43
05:31.168 --> 05:35.570
On the last screen we have the same widget with a button and of course everything works.
