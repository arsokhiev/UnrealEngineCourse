Another section has come to an end. Let's pack the project.

00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:17.720
Let's check all the settings in GameModeBase, set RoundsNum = 4, round time = 30 seconds.

00:00:18.912 --> 00:00:25.538
Also in AICharacter in the healtch component we removed autoheal - we set the property to true.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:33.358
And let's check the map settings: we can now return the EditorStartupMap to TestLevel.

00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:39.596
And GameDefaultMap should be in MenuLevel. This level will be loaded when the game starts.

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:49.494
We can all package the project. We check the build configuration, let it be shipping, select windows 64-bit and start packing.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:58.218
The game has assembled successfully. Everything works for us, we can select the level, press start game, the preloader is shown.

00:00:58.738 --> 00:01:05.573
The level is loaded, the pause works. Press continue, the user interface is also updated.

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:12.650
Let's check the lives of the enemy characters. Everything works. We will not wait until the end

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.890
to look at the statistics. Let's go back to the main menu and close the game by clicking on quit.
