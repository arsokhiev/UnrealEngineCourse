00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:11.301
In this lesson, we will add an additional button, when you click on which, the game will close.

00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:18.920
In the header file of the widget menu, add a new property. Let's call the button QuitGameButton.

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:23.585
And also add a callback function - OnQuitGame.

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:28.276
We create the body of the function.

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:34.358
We need an additional header file Kismet / KismetSystemLibrary.h

00:00:34.796 --> 00:00:39.950
This library contains a convenient helper function that allows us to shutdown the game.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.366
Add a callback to our new button's OnClicked delegate.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:59.863
The function from the library that allows you to complete the game process is called QuitGame.

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:02.395
It has several parameters:

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:10.499
The first is the World Context Object - we pass a pointer to the current instance. The second is the playercontroller, in the view we get the pointer to it using

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:12.582
the GetOwningPlayer function.

00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:17.800
Next, you need to pass an enum element called EQuitPreference.

00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:25.730
We pass Quit. And the last parameter is not important for us. Let's set it to true.

00:01:29.434 --> 00:01:30.473
We compile the project.

00:01:31.507 --> 00:01:35.119
Copy the size box containing the start game button.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.774
We will align from the top right edge. Set the position value to 0.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.293
We also set the x alignment to one. For size box, set size to content to true.

00:01:52.075 --> 00:01:55.732
Let's add some margins, x = -50.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:05.384
For y, just 50. Slightly reduce the size: let it be 200 by 50.

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:10.108
Change the text on the button to Quit.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.352
Set the font = 20.

00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:21.843
And let's make the width even smaller, let it be 150.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.177
Call our button quit game button.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.970
We start the game. Click on the button. The window closes. Everything works.
