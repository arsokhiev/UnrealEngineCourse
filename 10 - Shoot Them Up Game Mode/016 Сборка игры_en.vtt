00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:10.131
Before packaging the game, I recommend that you set adequate values ​​in GameData.

00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:18.213
The number of players is 4, the number of rounds is 4, the round time is 30, respawn can be left at the default 5 seconds.

00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:25.258
Also during testing, we changed the health component of the NPC character, so we check that the number of lives is 100

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:32.737
and auto heal is on. I changed the position of the PlayerStart actors, set them at the edges of the scene.

00:00:33.287 --> 00:00:38.250
In fact, if you wish, you can create your own PlayerStart class, add a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.030
property - TeamId to it and in game mode select the point for the player to spawn, depending on which

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.460
team he is on. This can actually be useful for game balance to know exactly

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.844
where which players are spawning. Also, to improve the quality of the code, you can add a check to the game mode,

00:00:56.844 --> 00:01:01.933
which will check that the number of PlayerStart is not less than the number of players.

00:01:02.772 --> 00:01:04.000
We pack the game.

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:11.130
The game has been successfully assembled, this is where the current section ends.
