Hello everyone. In this lesson, we will create a component for managing the health of a character.

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:16.912
Let's learn to take damage. Let's make an automatic renewal of life.

00:00:18.106 --> 00:00:22.225
Let's figure out how to damage a character when falling from a height.

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:33.600
Let's add the animation of death to the character and consider the spectator mode - the observer mode, that is, the mode

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.213
in which we control the free camera after the death of the character.
