Hello everyone! In this section, we will create our project with you.

00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:13.612
Let's import the materials we need from the unreal ShooterGame training project.

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:20.130
Let's create the base classes of the game, set up our character. Let's learn how to control it with a mouse and keyboard.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.059
And the main emphasis will be on customizing the animation of the character's movement. We will teach him to run forward,

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:33.393
backward, right, left. Consider the animation of a jump, acceleration, work with you in both c ++

00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:39.320
and blueprints and learn how to manage animation states and transitions between them.
