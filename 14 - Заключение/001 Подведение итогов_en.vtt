Congratulations to everyone on completing the course and thank you for watching it to the end.

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:14.511
We figured out the specifics of C ++ development in the Unreal Engine.

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:20.870
We studied various subsystems and programmed all the logic exclusively in C ++.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.834
If you liked the course, I would be grateful for your feedback.

00:00:25.617 --> 00:00:26.987
What to do next?

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:31.638
First, you can continue to develop our current project on your own.

00:00:31.638 --> 00:00:35.472
For example, add new characters and make it possible to choose them.

00:00:35.927 --> 00:00:41.563
Characters can be found in the Unreal marketplace. There are many free options out there.

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:48.124
You can create a system of difficulty level and change various parameters of bots, depending on it.

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:51.948
Or, for example, create a mechanic for the selection of a special totem

00:00:52.304 --> 00:00:56.538
AND count the victory for the team if at the end of the round it owns it.

00:00:56.921 --> 00:01:00.948
Etc. You can think of anything you want and try to implement it.

00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:06.558
Secondly, you can continue to study Unreal, depending on the specifics of your activity.

00:01:06.914 --> 00:01:15.372
If you are an idie developer, then learning unreal will happen depending on what is required to implement your game mechanics. This is logical.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.118
If you are planning to work in a large company, then it makes sense to thoroughly study several subsystems.

00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:26.781
For example, you can delve deeper into artificial intelligence, user interface programming, or animation programming.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:32.382
But no matter what you do, it is extremely important to devote due time to the documentation, to study it carefully.

00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:39.732
Also, in training, I recommend not to focus only on the Unreal Engine. Improve various other programmer skills.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.670
Study software design methodologies, testing, refactoring, follow the development of the C ++ standard,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.917
read and watch professional blogs.

00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:53.398
All this knowledge can be easily transferred to projects based on the Unreal Engine,

00:01:53.623 --> 00:02:00.000
while the speed and quality of development can be greatly improved. All this together will help create your dream project.

00:02:00.827 --> 00:02:04.351
Also in the description, I will leave a link to my YouTube channel,

00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:11.241
which covers the topics of unreal development automation, source building, testing and much more.

00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:15.054
Thanks again for watching this course.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.000
Wish you luck! Bye everyone!
